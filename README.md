# Trailcast

Trailcast is a university project, in which the brief was to create a mobile weather app with a focus on GUI. This web application is React-based and provides real-time weather information and hiking safety tips for outdoor enthusiasts. Users can search for weather conditions in different locations, view multi-day forecasts, and receive tailored hiking advice based on current weather.

## Features

- **Weather Search:** Search for any city to get current weather details (temperature, wind, sunrise/sunset, etc.).
- **Multi-Day Forecast:** View upcoming weather for several days.
- **Hiking Tips & Cautions:** Get safety tips and cautions based on weather conditions.
- **Map Integration:** Visualize the searched location on a map.
- **Responsive UI:** Works well on desktop and mobile devices.
